				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <P>What is affiliate marketing? Affiliate marketing is where you promote another merchant&#8217;s product for a commission. If you need to make money online in 14 days and have no time to create your own products, this is an ideal way to get started.</P><br />
<P>To get started as an affiliate, you need to first determine the niche that you want to promote. Many people make a mistake of promoting products or services that they desire without a proper market research. If you seriously need to make money online fast, never take this approach! The result can be disastrous!</P><br />
<P>So, how to find a niche market that can sell? An easy way is by looking at popular websites like Amazon.com. Check out their best-selling books. This will give you a rough idea of what is hot or sellable. If you need to make money online fast, then promote products under the hot niche.</P><br />
<P>Another effective way is of course by doing a keyword search using Google AdWords Tool. This will give you a very good idea on the types of product the market is interested in or looking for.</P><br />
<P>Once you have decided on the niche market, next step is to get affiliate products or services relating to your niche market. The best web place to find affiliate products is ClickBank.com. This is the website where many who need to make money online get affiliate products.</P><br />
<P>Then, set up a website with quality contents relating to your niche market. Quality contents will improve your website&#8217;s ranking on search engines like Google.com and Yahoo.com and send free traffic to your websites.</P><br />
<P>In your website, promote affiliate products relating to your niche market.</P><br />
<P>A great way to promote products is by writing and publishing a product review on your website. Reviews are regarded as an unbiased view and that will enhance your visitors&#8217; confidence on the product, or rather you.</P><br />
<P>Last but not least, drive traffic to your website! Without traffic, you won&#8217;t get any sale. If you need to make money online fast, promote your website like crazy!</P><br />
<P>The fastest way to get highly targeted traffic is by advertising your website with major search engines like Google or social media like Facebook. These are the two very powerful marketing tools presently. You can also promote your website using other free traffic methods like social medias (e.g. Facebook, MySpace, Twitter), writing and submitting articles relating to your niche market to articles directories like EzineArticles etc., but the result may take time.</P><br />
<P>So, if you need to make money online in 14 days, find a hot niche, sign up as an affiliate marketer and start promoting the affiliate product like crazy!<BR /></P></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <P>Fear will cause you to come up with all kinds of good sounding reasons that you are not enjoying the kind of success you are wanting from your online home business. Fear of losing will keep you away from pay per click. Fear of failure will keep you from writing simple articles. Fear of the unknown will keep you from calling a hot prospect. Fear will kill your dreams!</P><P>There are so many books in the self help section of any bookstore you walk in. With so many resources it makes you wonder why there would be anyone left in this world who can not do what they set out to do.</P><P>You do your research and find out all you can about starting an online home business. You have found out so many things that you didn&#8217;t know before about internet marketing and search engine optimization, your mind is brimming with ideas. And you just sit there. You ponder. You wonder. You plan. You goal set. You&#8230;  Do you get the picture?</P><P>Every one of us has been there before, haven&#8217;t we? It reminds me of my grandmom.  Grandmom made the most delicious biscuits on earth! One morning we were all anxiously waiting for those delicious biscuits to come out of the oven to eat them hot with butter and jam. The smell alone was making us crazy with anticipation of the delights to come. Oh man, we were slobbering! When the timer went off and they came out of the oven the biscuits looked nothing like Grandmom&#8217;s usual biscuits. They were flat and firm. Everybody asked, &#8220;Grandma, what happened to your biscuits?&#8221; I&#8217;ll never forget what she said. Grandmom answered, &#8220;It looks like they squatted to rise and got cooked in the squat!&#8221;</P><P>How many of us do that with our plans, our lives, our dreams? We have our dreams, we make our plans and then what? And then&#8230;they get cooked in the squat! At some point you come to the understanding that they don&#8217;t look like what we set out to accomplish.</P><P>You can learn all there is to know about a particular subject. You can make plans for everything that you want. You can dream the most lofty of dreams and nothing, absolutely nothing will happen until you stand up out of your squat and do something about it.  You won&#8217;t know if your plans will work or not if you don&#8217;t actually do them.</P><P>Even if you have taken the first step and started an online home business, do you find yourself coming up with excuses for not doing the things that you know will drive your business forward another notch? Those excuses you hear is fear talking.</P><P>For most people, just the act of dreaming about having something better for themselves and their family is all they need or want to satisfy that longing. For many people that is really all they want, a good feeling. It gives people something to aim at even if they never end up taking a shot at it. They still have the feeling of hope if for no other reason than they are thinking about their dream. They still have the desire and the &#8220;plan.&#8221;</P><P>Don&#8217;t get cooked in the squat. You are able to accomplish your dream.</P><P>The solution is very simple.  Stand up out of the squat&#8230;and Do Something!</P></p>

The best way to overcome the fear that is holding you back is to take action. Surround yourself with people who have been there and done that. Take action Now! Contact me, and let&#8217;s get you started in a big way. <a href="http://bigticketpuncher.com">http://bigticketpuncher.com</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <P>In a previous article I discussed five very effective strategies for making money online, and how to work out which one is right for you depending on your personal strengths and resources.</P><P>I promised I would share with you my own successes and failures in pursuing each of the 5 strategies. Of course it&#8217;s important to understand how success is achieved, but most of the gurus in time have confirmed that they learnt more from making mistakes. It was in correcting the mistakes that they found success, so it follows that getting out there and taking action, any action, may not lead to immediate success but will almost certainly lead to a mistake or learning experience that will propel you forward to success if you persevere.</P><P>I&#8217;d just like to point out that these are my personal experiences and may not be the same for you. Thankfully there is usually more than one pathway that leads to success &#8211; you just need to find the best way to make money online for you.</P><P>Affiliate Marketing</P><P>This is where you basically get paid for promoting somebody else&#8217;s product. It can be a book, service or goods, and you get part of the sale proceeds and part goes to the original retailer/writer. This really can be one of the best ways to make money online fast. The secret is research to find your target market with sufficient willing buyers for the right product. Then set up a simple one page website or review blog to tell people about the product &#8211; often give them some info for free. Then set up a Pay Per Click campaign to attract interested prospects to send along via a link to the sales page of the person promoting the product. Any sales are then linked back to you so you get your commission. No handling money, customer queries or stock.</P><P>As you can see, this is relatively simple and something that you can turn on or off and leave pretty much on autopilot once you have your adwords campaigns working well. There are of course other ways to attract traffic for free including article marketing, blogging, social bookmarking etc but pay per click allows you to turn on the traffic almost instantly &#8211; if you know what you are doing.</P><P>And here we have one of the two major issues with affiliate marketing. If you don&#8217;t know what you are doing with pay per click then it can be very, very time consuming and very expensive to constantly monitor, test and tweak your campaigns. It is an amazing traffic tool but I personally found that whilst the basics are relatively easy to follow, to be successful at it is a really steep learning curve. The methodology is constantly updating and it is also a very competitive arena. For me I found that whilst I really wanted to master it as I love technology, it was just too time consuming and I did not have the luxury of time as I was on a mission to replace my income by finding the best way to make money online fast.</P><P>The potential way around this of course is to find someone who is an expert in pay per click and outsource the task to them. We won&#8217;t go into that now but suffice to say that as with any service providers there are good and bad ones so always try to go by recommendation if you can. Elance is a good online site to find IT people you can source tasks to. Personally I found someone skilled I could trust and traded my skills and services with theirs to achieve win-win for us both.</P><P>The other issue with affiliate marketing of course is finding the right product that is going to make money online. Again this is a topic in its own right and is where I failed in not doing sufficient research on keywords and market share to ensure there was a sufficient pool of willing buyers out there to target.</P><P>Affiliate marketing is a superb strategy that works and the beauty of it is that it can be set up to be fully automated to make money online fast and hands free.</P><P>In future articles I will share my experiences of advertising, ecommerce, participation, and subscription.</P></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <P>There are many online earning methods, but none as powerful as the concept of multiple streams of income.  Learn more here.</P><P>They&#8217;ve all learned a powerful secret&#8230;.the power of having multiple streams of income.</P><P>Think about it like this&#8230;.let&#8217;s say you have a job, it is your only job.  You have one stream of income.  What if you lost your job&#8230;now you have no income.  But what if you had 3 jobs.  If you lost 1 job, you would still have two.  Things aren&#8217;t as bad now, are they?</P><P>The same concept can be applied as a business model for small business online.  But when you have a business making money online, you can create multiple streams of income without having to work 3 jobs.</P><P>How?</P><P>Let&#8217;s say you found a product to promote through an affiliate program.  Write some articles about it, do some marketing, and soon you start making some sales.  You might think it isn&#8217;t worth your time and effort and then give up on your hopes of making a good income online.</P><P>If you do that, though, you stopped to soon.  If you stop to soon, you will fall short of starting an business online and working from home.</P><P>The secret? Get a promotion set up on auto-pilot, then another and so on.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  When you learn how to make money the easy way, starting an business will be much more rewarding ( and fun! ).</P><P>Let&#8217;s say I create a blog.  This is super easy to do on Google&#8217;s Blogger.  WordPress is another good site.  I find a service or product at places such as Clickbank or Commission Junction to promote.  Now I blog on those items, doing reviews, maybe posting sometimes about problems those products can solve, or what have you.  Next, add Google&#8217;s Adsense ads to my blog.  Maybe I throw in related products from Amazon.com.  I could also link to other items within my blog posts that I am affiliated with.  I just created the potential for multiple streams of income just on that blog.  Next I promote it with a few articles submitted to directories.  Then I eventually make a little money.</P><P>The great thing is, once I have done that, my site can be run on autopilot with almost no future effort required, and will continue to pull in some money.  Let&#8217;s say I make $50 per month with the site.</P><P>So now if I have this site running itself, and I know I can make money with a website, why would I not make another and do the same.  Then another, and so on?  You can start to see the potential here.</P><P>It is possible to create multiple streams of income that will pay you for life.</P><P>If that sounds like too much work, you can have someone setup a website making money.  Look around&#8230;.you can find any service imaginable on the internet.</P><P>Having multiple streams of income is essential if you desire to become a full-time internet entrepreneur.  If one stream of income goes bad, you still have others.  If you don&#8217;t make big money on any one stream, it is still possible to make a good income on all of your income streams combined.</P><P>What are some services or products that you like and use.  Sign up for the affiliate programs of every one and promote them every chance you get.</P><P>If you do this consistently, you will be on the way to making multiple streams of income for yourself.  Starting an business online can be fun and rewarding</P></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <P>Many Americans are looking to work online at home. This is a necessity for many low income families that are trying to weather rising fuel prices and a looming recession. The internet is a low-cost medium that allows businesses to reach a large, global audience instantaneously. Leveraging upon this powerful platform will allow you to get rich when you work online at home.</P><P>Given the reach and depth of the internet, deciding on the best way to leverage upon the internet for financial gain can be a daunting task. But the task becomes less daunting when we examine existing business models that have been applied to this dynamic landscape.</P><P>One of the most appealing ways of making money is by selling products online. Many ebay sellers are employed in full-time positions. They moonlight by selling products online. Becoming an online retailer can be fun if you have a strong interest or hobby.</P><P>By using auction sites to sell items, you have the luxury of starting out small. Starting out small is a low-cost, low-risk way of getting your feet wet. To gain some experience, you may want to consider selling items you do not need. These can be items lying around your home that are never used. Most sellers start out this way. They rid themselves of unwanted gifts or &#8216;white elephants&#8217; by selling them online.</P><P>Be warned that selling on ebay can get very addictive. When most sellers make their first sale, the entire ebay experience starts to overwhelm them. The sellers receive payment, the item is shipped out and if all goes well, the buyer leaves positive feedback for the seller, spurring the budding entrepreneur into looking for the next item to sell.</P><P>The entire process can be fun and engaging. Selling products on ebay can not only be profitable, but it can also connect you with other consumers who share the same interests and passions with you. Making sales and receiving enquires also allows you to build leads that you can leverage upon to make future sales.</P><P>Once your business has matured, it may become viable to start an online retail outlet. There are many ways to start an e-store. Various websites such as ebay and Amazon.com have easy to use tools that will allow you to build an online store. Unfortunately, creating an Amazon.com or ebay store can be expensive.</P><P>These services may charge a set-up fee and an annual fee on top of receiving commissions from any sale made by your online store. Creating an online store on these platforms will allow you to access the wide consumer base and reach that is enjoyed by these popular media vehicles. Alternatively, you can set up your own online retail outlet that is entirely independent.

nothing was as descriptive as this web page I stumbled upon. It listed<br />

details on how easy the programs were and how much you could make each<br />

how easy it was to make money online. I always thought it was going to<br />
be hard, but filling out some surveys and writing some articles were<br />
not only quick and easy, but fun too.</p>

say is that making money online is much much easier than I thought. And<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  Freelance site is the place to make thousands of dollars per month. Buyers from all around the world come to freelance site and open projects. These projects are actually the job description. Service providers on the other hand place bids on these projects. Buyers then choose one or more winning bidder.<br />For buyers, registering at freelance sites is easy and fast. It will not take anymore than just few minutes for buyers to get register at freelance sites. After registering, buyers can then open new projects. Buyers need to provide some good details in the project description. Buyers have to describe in detail about the requirement of the jobs which they need to be done.<br />Many buyers who are using freelance sites, to hire people online, for the first time make a mistake of not describing the job details well enough in the project description. This can create problems for the buyer. The project description needs to have all the requirements for the job and these requirements must be explained well enough.<br />Some freelance sites require few dollars as a refundable fee; when opening a new project. Some freelance sites are totally free for the buyers. These freelance sites don&#8217;t charge anything to buyers.<br />If you want to get more bidders for your project then you can make your project featured. This will cost $20 to $30. Choose the correct category for the project. If you place the project in the wrong category then you will not see many people placing bids on your project. After posting a new project, you will need to wait for some time. You will see many people applying for the job. The number of bidders depends on the nature of the job and the freelance site which you are using.<br />Before you choose a winning bid, I suggest you first make sure that the person you are choosing is the right one. You can communicate with service providers via messaging system at freelance site.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Promoting affiliate programs is probably one of the most popular and realistic ways of making money online. You really can make money doing this, and the money can be substantial with some work. The type of affiliate program you use or promote will depend on your particular situation.</p>
<p>One of the most common types of affiliate programs is the pay per sale/pay per lead program. These are also called CPA or cost per action affiliate programs. These pay you for sales and for other actions that your referred customers make. This type of program can be promoted on websites and in other ways depending on the particular programs terms. It is very versatile.</p>
<p>CPC (cost per click) programs pay you when vistors to your site click on your ads. You are paid per click. There are also PPC (pay per click) programs which are similar. CPC programs are great for websites with content.</p>
<p>CPM (cost per mille) affiliate programs pay you for showing ads on your website. You are paid per 1000 impressions &#8211; per 1000 times the ad is shown on your website. This is great for websites that get a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>All three types can pay very well. It is a good idea to experiment and see what works for you. Some people like to use multiple affiliate programs on a site, such as a cpc program and a cpa program, or some other combination. If you are thinking of doing non website based promotion, CPA programs are worth considering.</p>
