    <h1>So Why Do You Do What You Do? </h1>
    <p>This topic is a favorite of mine. I'm about to share with
      you a very, very vital (yet overlooked) technique that never fails. That&rsquo;s
      right. NEVER fails. I always stress this technique when I&rsquo;m coaching
      new Home Business Owners and Entrepreneurs. Works like a charm. </p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m even giving you some homework this weekend
      because I think the dog days of summer may be getting the best of you
      and I want to keep you sharp ;)</p>
    <p>So let&rsquo;s dive in&hellip;</p>
    <p>In today's society we often put a lot of emphasis on HOW things are
      done. Present a plan with lofty goals to the board of directors of any
      company and surely they will ask you <em>how</em> you suppose those goals
      will be met. Apply for a mortgage and you will be asked to demonstrate <em>how</em> you
      plan to pay it off. Give a professor the correct answer to a complex
      question and chances are you'll be asked <em>how</em> you arrived at
      your conclusion. </p>
    <p>The HOW is often so predominant that the WHY is sometimes completely
      forgotten, as if the WHY is of less importance. Nothing could be further
      from the truth. WHY you want something is infinitely more important than
      HOW you think you're going to achieve it.</p>
    <p>Phew. That was tiring just to write. Did you get all that?</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this newsletter today, chances are you&rsquo;re
      a Home Business Owner and Entrepreneur and there is a reason WHY? But
      do you know the reason WHY??</p>
    <p>I hope you do&hellip;</p>
    <p>But if you don&rsquo;t (and most don&rsquo;t), then it&rsquo;s time
      you found out. If you&rsquo;re not achieving the results you would like
      to be achieving in your Home Business enterprise, chances are very good
      that this is why (no pun intended). </p>
    <p>Stay with me now. It&rsquo;s gut check time&hellip;</p>
    <p>To find out what you&rsquo;re WHY is may just be as simple as identifying
      what it is that you want, right? Everyone knows what they want, right? </p>
    <p>Wrong&hellip; </p>
    <p>It's a bit more challenging than one would think. Ask an adult to write
      down everything they want on a list with a minimum of 10 items and you
      will find that for most it turns out to be quite difficult. </p>
    <p>Stating that you want a certain amount of money, want to quit working
      or just want a bigger car than your neighbor can cause people to experience
      discomfort. After all, it may make them appear greedy or lazy and that's
      not generally considered positive. So they try to come up with something
      that's socially acceptable and in doing so, make what they want subject
      to the opinions of others. Not good.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s the interesting part&hellip;</p>
    <p>Kids on the other hand have no problem here. They'll come up with 10
      items and more in no time, listing things you didn't even know exist.
      They don't worry about what others may think of it, whether it makes
      them look greedy, lazy or whatever. All they know is that they want it.
      Fascinating when you think about. </p>
    <p>You see, kids have not yet been brainwashed or conditioned into thinking
      that they can&rsquo;t have certain things. They just assume they can
      have anything they want, right?</p>
    <p>And so can you. You just may not realize it yet.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a very effective exercise for you that will really bring
      to light exactly what it is that you want in life so you can pin point
      your WHY.</p>
    <p>Chances are you've never done this...</p>
    <p>Figure out what it is that you DON&rsquo;T want <em>first</em> and what
      you do want will become crystal clear. This is a technique called &ldquo;clarity
      through contrast&rdquo;   and it basically states that when you observe
      what it is that you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want in life it then it delivers
      clarity which makes it clear what you <em>do</em> want.</p>
    <p>Easy enough right? Here comes the hard part&hellip;</p>
    <p>Write it down now. Make a list of the things you DON&rsquo;T want in
      life. It will only take you a few minutes and it&rsquo;s actually a pretty
      fun exercise because when you actually come to terms with what you DON&rsquo;T
      want it becomes clear what you DO want. The peace of mind you will experience
      by being clear is just, well&hellip;you&rsquo;ll see.</p>
    <p>After you&rsquo;ve identified what it is you want, then you get to your
      all important WHY. </p>
    <p>So why would you want all those things? Again, kids have the upper hand
      here. They'll be quick to point out why they want it all: mostly the
      fun they will have and the popularity it will give them. Ask an adult
      why they want something and you'll enjoy watching the expression on their
      face. You'll see them searching for an answer. </p>
    <p>Why would you want to be rich? Why would you want to quit working to
      have your own business? What would you do if you no longer had to go
      to a job every day? You may decide you want a bigger house than anyone
      in your family before you ever had. </p>
    <p>But what does that do for you? Would you sleep better? Would it make
      your life better? Would it make you happier? Whatever it is, it's critical
      that you know. </p>
    <p>Exactly HOW you plan to achieve your success is far less important,
      especially early on. Too much focus on the HOW early in the process can
      have a devastating effect. It could paralyze you. I call it &quot;analysis
      paralysis.&quot;</p>
    <p>If your financial situation is so bad that you're actually below broke
      then achieving financial independence can seem so far fetched that reaching
      it appears impossible. You might sell yourself on the idea that it's
      so far out of reach that you couldn't possibly make it happen in this
      lifetime. As much as that may seem true at the time, it doesn't have
      to become your reality. Don&rsquo;t be sold. </p>
    <p>However, in order to get there you will probably have to overcome some
      serious hurdles. And for that to happen, you need a reason to get up
      and take the necessary action. That reason needs to be strong enough
      to pull you through the tough times that inevitably will come. That reason
      is your WHY. </p>
    <p>History is packed with unbelievable stories of accomplishment. People
      facing seemingly insurmountable odds who overcame obstacles you wouldn't
      believe. Individuals with relentless determination who decided to push
      on in situations where most people would give up. </p>
    <p>Why is that so many people throw in the towel when things don't go their
      way and only a small number of people seem to persevere? </p>
    <p>It's not because they are genetically stronger and it's not because
      they have been dealt a better hand in life. What sets them apart is their
      WHY. That's what keeps them in the game. Their WHY is so strong that
      whatever gets in their way, they will find a way to deal with it. They
      don't have all the answers, but what they do have is an inner conviction
      that they can and will find the answers. </p>
    <p>...And they are crystal clear about what they want. </p>
    <p>Nailing down your WHY is one of the most powerful ways to improve your
      chances of success with your home business. So make sure that you know
      what your WHY is. Find it and refine it over and over again. Make it
      so strong that achieving it becomes an absolute must for you and the
      HOW will absolutely reveal itself to you over time. Trust me.</p>
    <p>Take action. </p>
    <p><strong>P.S.</strong> Don&rsquo;t forget your homework assignment. Make
      a list of the things you DON'T want and you will instantly see what you
      DO want. Your WHY will appear right before your eyes. Don&rsquo;t take
      this assignment lightly. I&rsquo;ve done this many times and it is quite
      dramatic what your new found clarity will bring you</p>
