    <h1>Work Smart &amp; Get Paid</h1>
    <p>We all know some of the reasons people decide to start their own home 
      business&mdash;flexibility, no boss, financial independence, and more time with family. These 
      are the benefits of network-marketing success, and 
      they attract new people to the industry every day. </p>
    <p>But just as important as the advantages are the 
      aspects of the field that turn people away: lack of sales 
      experience, no confidence on the phone, the inability 
      to recruit, shaky products, and poor management. Jay 
      Kubassek and several of his top producers decided to 
      create a business that addressed the concerns of the 
      latter group, assuming a clear path to success could 
      be found by putting systems in place that help people 
      automatically clear the hurdles in front of them. </p>
    <p>This was the thinking that led Jay to the create 
      CarbonCopyPRO.com, an internet marketing 
      &ldquo;business in a box&rdquo; that gives average people the 
      marketing power of an internet powerhouse. The four- 
      year-old company enables anyone to go toe-to-toe 
      with veteran networkers and puts them in a position 
      to earn a six-figure income without any background 
      knowledge or prior marketing experience. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really my way of making my marketing 
      techniques work for the average person who 
      wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise stand a chance of success,&rdquo; Jay 
      says. &ldquo;How do we eliminate the sales and marketing 
      variables for Joe Blow coming in off the street? 
      It began as a way for me to take my personal 
      marketing experience and success&mdash;ad copy, auto 
      responders, my website, &ldquo;carbon copy&rdquo; it, and make 
      that available for other people. Along the way it 
      started to snowball as we attracted more and more 
      industry leaders and top income earners. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Everything else out there requires the 
      new marketer to go out, learn the techniques of 
      marketing, of sales, and then identify an opportunity 
      and give it their best shot,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;You look at 
      years of trial and error and long, frustrating learning 
      curves. CarbonCopyPRO is different in the sense </p>
    <p>Jay knows full well how difficult it is to jump 
      into the network marketing world without a life 
      preserver. After years of working 60- and 70-hour 
      weeks and still only making enough money to pay 
      the bills, he decided to try a home-based business 
      as a way of supplementing his income as a Midas 
      store manager where he was selling brakes and tires 
      to people. &ldquo;I followed the system, bought leads, 
      called my leads, put people on the conference calls 
      and sent them to websites,&rdquo; he remembers. &ldquo;I did 
      three-way calls, talked, preached, ranted, sang, and 
      sold the company and products. I was marketing 
      to anyone who would listen.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The problem was, none of that worked. His 
      sponsors got rich while Jay went to sleep exhausted 
      and broke. Eventually, he came to the realization that 
      his process wasn&rsquo;t working. Rather than throwing in 
      the towel, Jay took what he learned through two and 
      a half years of failure and vowed to create a system 
      that actually benefitted the average networker.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I thought to myself, what if I could take 
      everything I had learned and create a marketing system 
      that would eliminate most if not all of the variables, 
      a system that would work for me and everyone who 
      got started with me?&rdquo; Jay says. &ldquo;This was the genesis 
      of CarbonCopyPRO. Everything that was proven to 
      work was duplicated and taught to each new member. 
      This dramatically reduced learning curves, eliminated 
      guess work, and increased results for everyone.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Four years later, and it&rsquo;s obvious Jay and his 
      partners were on to something. CarbonCopyPRO 
      went from holding its own against bigger 
      networking companies to increasing by nearly 500 
      percent in gross commission. By having a system 
      and call center in place to handle all the marketing, 
      recruiting, phone interactions, and communication 
      aspects of the business, home-based rookies and 
      veterans alike are achieving unprecedented success 
      at unmatched levels.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Typically, you have to have a success story 
      before people will work with you in this industry, 
      and when you&rsquo;re new, you have no story. It&rsquo;s a bad 
      catch-22,&rdquo; Jay explains. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not marketing 
      yourself here, you&rsquo;re marking a network, a system, a 
      community, and an idea. All the emphasis is put on 
      the success of the group and the system; not on you. A 
      lot of our members make most of their money without 
      ever talking to their new customers. You just pay us a 
      monthly fee and we do the grunt work for you.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>CarbonCopyPRO can be applied to any 
      business or product line. Currently, the company 
      is exclusively partnered with Wealth Masters 
      International, handpicked by Jay because &ldquo;they offer 
      the highest value product line in the industry, and 
      we want to provide our distributors with a quality 
      business. We believe they&rsquo;re the best product line 
      out there, and that&rsquo;s why we chose them.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Jay has come full circle in four years, 
      transitioning from corporate America to a home- 
      based business in network marketing and finally, 
      with CarbonCopyPRO.com thriving, back to 
      corporate America. He and two partners run the 
      business from their Manhattan offices where they 
      employ a full-time staff of four. They also have 13 
      contract workers acting as professional business 
      coaches who personally work with members to 
      ensure each person&rsquo;s business is growing to the 
      level they desire.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back to the 10-6, Monday through 
      Friday schedule, and I absolutely love it, because 
      this time it&rsquo;s about building my own company, 
      not someone else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Jay says. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why 
      I created this business&mdash;I want everyone to be 
      able to experience this same feeling of personal 
      freedom and success, and now they finally have a 
      real, proven way to do it.&rdquo;</p>
