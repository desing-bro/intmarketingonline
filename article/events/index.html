    <h1>The Quiet, Explosive Surge Of LIVE Events In The Internet Marketing World...</h1>
    <p>So this may come as a surprise to many of you...</p>
    <p>There is a very interesting and quiet trend unfolding in the Internet Marketing world these days that is fascinating, in my opinion.</p>
    <p>Check this out...</p>
    <p>Just when the Internet Marketing community became comfortable with the joys of working from home, the rise of offline Internet Marketing events and conferences has brought people in droves to hotels and conference centers around the world. If you aren't planning on adding your name to the list of attendees, you may be missing a prime opportunity for growing your home business at a phenomenal rate.</p>
    <p>Simply put, networking in person is alive and kicking! Even though we all enjoy the benefits that the work at home lifestyle affords, showing up in person at a live Internet Marketing event or conference is close to becoming a mandatory part of your business plan these days.</p>
    <p>Case in point...</p>
    <p>Have you ever exchanged a series of emails with someone, only to meet them in person and realize they were totally different than you expected? Or perhaps it was even a telephone call that followed the emails and when you spoke to the individual, there was a personality that emerged that the prior emails didn't accurately convey?</p>
    <p>Of course you have. We all have...</p>
    <p>This experience is exactly what you'll find when you attend live events. We are all used to forming opinions based upon the written word, but when you have a chance to &quot;hear&quot; the person behind the email or the web site, it will almost invariably lead to an opportunity to bond on a much deeper level with someone. And in many cases, what you find will amaze and surprise you. Trust me on this one.</p>
    <p>The reality of all this has opened the door to Internet Marketing events and conferences that are popping up all over the globe. In years past, there were only 4 or 5 main events that took center stage each year. But now, if you keep an ear to the ground, no matter where you live, an event is bound to spring up in your community or at the very least somewhere within an hour or two drive from where you call home.</p>
    <p>Who would have expected this phenomenon?</p>
    <p>Simply put, LIVE events are increasing to keep up with demand and also to make it easy and affordable for everyone to attend. It is no longer about traveling half way around the country or the world to get to an event. They are easy to find in your own backyard.</p>
    <p>Because these events no longer require an obscene amount of money just to show up, this is a perfect opportunity to get to such an event and start to make yourself known. While there, you will find Internet Marketers and high level Entrepreneurs at every phase of their careers and plentiful opportunities will abound. The best of the best in any industry attend the live events. Period.</p>
    <p>If you're just starting out, you will find guidance, mentors and friends while creating life long relationships. If you're a seasoned marketer, you will find many clients and opportunities to Joint Venture (JV) with in your niche.</p>
    <p>Not to mention, live Internet Marketing events and conferences are a great time. You often times even get to check out new cities that you've never been to before, PLUS they are 100% tax deductible against ALL of your household income. Thats a win / win / win in my book! Not to mention, the obvious eductaion you will receive.</p>
    <p>No matter what your level of understanding, getting an opportunity to get to know someone personally is one of the most invaluable experiences you can have and will often lead to life changing paths that you otherwise would never have been able to cultivate.</p>
    <p>I've been to 8 live events this year so far and I have 2 more on the schedule between now and year end. Each one has had a specific and measurable impact on my business.</p>
    <p>Book your next live event and take your education along with your Home Business enterprise to a whole new level this year. Guaranteed. </p>
