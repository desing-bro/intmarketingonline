<h2>5 Tips For Staying <em>Razor Sharp</em> When Starting Your Home
  Business Enterprise</h2>
<p>So, you've decided to start a home-based business? <br />
        <br />
        Good for you!<br />
        <br />
        You've just joined the ranks of 79 million North Americans who are expected
        to start their own home based business in the next 3 to 5 years according
        to Forbes Magazine. <br />
        <br />
        You may be juggling a full time job, a part time job and family life.
        You know that there are many things you need to do in order to successfully
        start your business and work from home.<br />
        <br />
        Don't let anyone fool you into thinking its going to be easy. It can
        be <em>simple</em> but it won't be easy. If it were easy everyone would
        be rich working from home.<br />
        <br />
        How are you going to fit your business project into your daily commitments? <br />
        <br />
        It's easy to become overwhelmed and lose focus. Losing focus will cause
        you to take no action. <em><strong>Action</strong></em> is essential
        to moving on from where you are now, to where you want to go.</p>
      <p>Here are 5 critical tips for staying focused and <em>razor sharp</em> when
        starting your home business enterprise... </p>
      <h3>1. Break It Down: </h3>
      <p>If you have a large task to tackle, it is always easier when you break
        it down into smaller components. You'll find it easier to focus because
        you won't feel as overwhelmed. For example, 'Register a business name'
        can be broken down into: 'Think of five business name ideas', 'Find out
        how to register a business name', 'Get registration form' and so on. </p>
      <h3>2. Keep A 'To Do' List:</h3>
      <p>Once you've broken down major tasks into smaller ones, make and keep
        a 'to do' list. Always keep a note pad and pen with you so that you can
        jot down any new ideas as they arise. </p>
      <h3>3. Schedule Your Time:</h3>
      <p>Every evening, decide on three to five tasks on your 'to do' list that
        you wish to accomplish the following day. Stay focused on these tasks
        and only move on to the next tasks on your list once these have been
        completed. </p>
      <h3>4. Set Goals: </h3>
      <p>This is critical. There is nothing that will keep you more focused than
        setting goals <em>and</em> writing out your goals. Visualize exactly
        where you want to be in a month, six months and a year. <br />
        <br />
        In a month's time, do you want to have registered a business name and
        have a fully functional home office set up? In three months time, how
        many clients or team members do you want? How much revenue do you want
        to generate in a six month's time?</p>
      <h3>5. Say No: </h3>
      <p>Be assertive and carve out more time for your home business. Saying &lsquo;no'
        to that extra demand by your boss every once in a while can get you home
        one hour earlier a couple of days a week. </p>
      <p>How about cutting back on the amount of housework that you do? How about
        watching less TV? Thats a BIG time zapper. Imagine how you could channel
        that extra time into your home business enterprise... </p>
      <p>If you put these 5 tips into practice, you'll definitely find it easier
        to focus and stay <em>razor sharp</em> so you can achieve your ultimate
        goal of working from home and putting more <em>LifeStyle</em> back in
        your life.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>P.S.</strong> Pay particular attention to Tip # 3 above. As a Home
    Business Owner and Entrepreneur, once you gain control of your time you will
    eventually have all the time you will ever need...</p>
